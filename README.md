# capstone_NYC_housing_complaints
This project provides solution to real-life business problems: 'Housing complaints in New York city'.


## Problem Statement
The people of New Yorker use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. 
In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.

Therefore, I have developed a solution to help the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to manage their large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year.

The project tries to answers several questions:

1. Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?
2. Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?
3. Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?
4. Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?

The project contains 4 jupyter notebooks each for one problem. It contains data analysis along with nice visualisations. 

## Datasets

Two datasets have been used from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City to address their problems.
